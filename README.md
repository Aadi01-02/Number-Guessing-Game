# Number-Guessing-Game
Overview
This simple web-based game allows users to guess a number between 1 and 100. The backend (Java) handles the game logic, and the frontend (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) provides the user interface.

How to Play
Open the game in your browser.
Enter a number within the specified range (1 to 100).
Keep guessing until your number matches the one chosen by the computer.
Youâ€™ll receive points based on the number of attempts it takes to guess correctly.
